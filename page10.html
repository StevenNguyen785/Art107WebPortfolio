    <h2>Title: <span class="title">Gym Life Shenanigans: Episode 4</span></h2>
    <h2>Dimension: <span class="title">1920x1080 screen resolution</span></h2>
    <h2>Medium: <span class="title">Adobe Premiere Pro editing with actual costumes and props.</span></h2>
    <h2>Brief Artist Statement About The Project: <span class="title">(SPOILER WARNING AHEAD ABOUT THE VIDEO ABOVE!) My love and joy from using Adobe softwares continue with the Season 1 Finale from my series, Gym Life Shenanigans. The storyline continues from Episode
        3, where the main character, Former Buff Guy is trying to find out who is his secret admirer with the help with his friends. Exactly from the previous episodes, I have used Adobe After Effects,
        Premiere Pro, and Photoshop as my main tools to develop
        this episode. All the jpeg and png files that were also used to make this episode are all from the internet. There will be a Season 2 of the series which is being planned but I do not know when it will commence. For Season 2, I want to
        incorporate the Blender 3D animation software in some shape or form. For example, I want to use sources from the Blender software to create or develop buildings or facial features for certain characters. Besides continuing my Gym Life
        Shenanigans series, I want to develop a brand new series which has nothing to do with Gym Life and combine the use Adobe and Blender softwares as well. I
        don't know when this new series will commence but possibly in the near future. </span></h2>
    <h2>Research Details:<span class="title">Similar to Episode 3, I have used different Adobe Software tools to develop Episode 4. Besides using hiclipart.com website, Google and Bing search engines are also good sources to find png and jpeg
        files.  I have read different blogs and artcles online about Adobe Software to improve my skills with this tool.</span>
