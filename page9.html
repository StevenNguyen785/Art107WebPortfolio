    <h2>Brief Artist Statement About The Projects: <span class="title">(SPOILER WARNING AHEAD ABOUT THE VIDEOS ABOVE!) This is the full length and prologue of Episode 3 from Gym Life Shenanigans. These are 2 different videos with 2 different narratives. In order for my
        series to be considered full length, it has to
        be more than 3 minutes. Episode 1 which is the pilot is
        roughly 2 minutes so I don't consider that full length compared to Episode 2 & 3. The pilot is mainly just a test video to see if I enjoyed using After Effects or not which in this case I really like using it. Full length Episode 3 is a
        continuation from Episode 3: Prologue in terms of the story. The prologue is a conintuation from Episode 2. The synopsis of the prologue is about Former Buff Guy had enagaged a relationship with Pretty Gym Girl. Full Length Episode 3 is about
        how Former Buff Guy is grieving after the break up by his former lover which is Pretty Gym Girl. Episode 4 is currently being developed and will be the first season
        finale. As usual, the tools that
        are being used to make Episode 4 are Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro which are the same ones I've used in the previous Episodes. I don't know if or when I start making the second season, but I am considering developing a
        brand new series using the same tools I used for the Gym Life Shenanigan series.

    <h2>Research Details: <span class="title">I have integrated humor from other TV Shows and sitcom into the series.
        The techniques that I learned from using different Adobe softwares are from various YouTube tutorials.
        The website, hiclipart.com is a good source to find almost any png images for a project.</span></h2>
